My Website
This Website is my personal blogging website, implemented in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Here's the link: https://waynium.github.io/Blogging-Website/

I will be sharing my fair share of coding experiences. But it is not only related to coding, but also
principles I learn in my life experience as well. I will be sharing my guitar progress, since 2020. I will
also be sharing some of my design artworks.
